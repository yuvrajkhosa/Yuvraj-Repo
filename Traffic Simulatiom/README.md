2D simulation of how a traffic wave or phantom wave occurs in traffic jams. One car slows down the whole road. Due to human reaction time.

Use any key to add a stop in the traffic and watch the traffic come to an ants crawl, then to a complete stop. Release the button to see it slowly pick up pace. Pay attention to how long it takes for the last car in the traffic wave to get back up to its full speed.
